That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see’st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west;
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest …

The third of four consecutive sonnets about ageing in Shakespeare’s 
154-sonnet sequence, this poem, beginning ‘That time of year thou mayst in me 
behold’, is a firm favourite for anthologists and sonnet fans. The gist of 
this poem is summed up by Don Paterson in Reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets thus:
 ‘The more decrepit I look, the more you’ll love me, as this reminds you that 
 I’ll be gone before you are’.
